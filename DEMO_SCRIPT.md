## 🔴 Problem (~15 seconds)

**Opening:**
> "Every tech team knows this: Endless status meetings. Nobody knows what others are doing. Manual updates in Jira, Slack, Notion - everything duplicated.
> 
> The result? 30% of work time goes to coordination, not building."

---

## 💻 Live Demo (~80 seconds)

### 1. Web App - Project Setup (20s)

*Show Dashboard*
> "This is Orgio. I already have a project here."

*Show Project Workspace*
> "The AI automatically generated tasks - for PM, Developer, Designer. Everyone sees what they need."

*Quickly show Kanban/Architecture*
> "Developer sees code specs, PM sees timeline, Designer sees user flows."

---

### 2. Desktop App - Session Tracking (40s)

*Show the Overlay*
> "The game-changer: The desktop app."

*Select project, click Start Session*
> "Start session - now Orgio automatically tracks what I'm doing."

*Show that it displays "Cursor - activityTracker.ts"*
> "It sees which app, which file I'm editing."

*Wait for the 3 Auto-Insights*
> "And here's where the magic happens: AI analyzes my screen and takes notes automatically."
> - "Refactoring ActivityTracker component"
> - "Adding TypeScript error handling"
> - "Optimizing screen capture"

> "I don't have to document anything - the AI sees what I'm doing."

*Click Stop Session*
> "End session - automatic summary."

*Show Summary*
> "8 minutes, 3 files edited, here's what I did."

---

### 3. The Loop - Sync (20s)

*Show Web-App*
> "And here's the kicker: The project board updates automatically."

> "The PM sees: Developer worked on authentication - task is done. No meetings needed."

*Briefly show MCP Hub*
> "And with MCP Hub we connect to Notion, Slack, Jira - everything in sync."

---

## 💡 Why It Matters (~15 seconds)

> "Why now? MCP is the new standard for AI tool integration. We're the first to use it for team collaboration."

> "The market: $50 billion for project management tools. But none of them automatically tracks what you do."

> "Orgio makes meetings obsolete. For every remote team wasting too much time on updates."

---

## 🚀 Vision (~10 seconds)

> "Where does this go? Imagine every tool in your stack being this intelligent. Code reviews, design feedback, deployment - all AI-powered."

> "One project. Zero meetings. That's Orgio."

---

## 🎯 Key Talking Points

- **Automatic** - no manual documentation
- **AI-powered** - GPT-4 Vision analyzes your screen
- **MCP-native** - integrates with everything
- **Role-based** - everyone sees what they need

---

## 🚨 Backup Plan

If something breaks:
1. **Session stuck** → "The session usually runs automatically, here I already have a recording"
2. **Backend down** → Show prepared screenshots
3. **Auth issue** → "Small auth issue, but the concept is clear"
